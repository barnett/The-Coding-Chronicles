The-Coding-Chronicles
=====================

Over the past 2 years I've gone from knowing nothing about programming to becoming a full-time backend developer. I blog about my more personal/business challenges over [here](https://www.medium.com/@barnettlklane) but wanted to start a more technical series.  I will post wikis about  coding topics along with my take and what I have learned.  No topic will ever be 'done' being discussed as I intend to constantly edit as discussion countinues around those topics.
